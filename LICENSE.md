# Hephaestus Forge / Hellas Unified Software License v1.0

Copyright © 2025–present  
xSasaki_Haise (Owner of the Hephaestus Forge)

This License governs all software, source code, binaries, assets, documentation and related materials
(collectively, the **“Software”**) published under the **Hephaestus Forge** or **Hellas** names, including
but not limited to all projects hosted under the GitHub account and/or organization of **xSasaki_Haise**
(“**Licensor**”), unless a specific project explicitly states a different license.

By downloading, cloning, forking, compiling, installing, running, or otherwise using any part of the
Software, you (“**Licensee**”) accept this License in full. If you do not agree, you are not permitted
to use the Software in any way.


## 1. Ownership

1.1. The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws.  
1.2. All rights, title, and interest in and to the Software remain solely with the Licensor.  
1.3. No rights are granted to the Licensee except those expressly stated in this License.


## 2. Grant of License (What You Are Allowed To Do)

Subject to full and ongoing compliance with this License, the Licensor grants to the Licensee a
limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

2.1. **Download and store** copies of the Software for personal use or internal, non-commercial
use within your own organization.

2.2. **View and study the source code** for educational, debugging, or interoperability purposes.

2.3. **Run the Software** in its original or unmodified form on your own machines or servers,
provided that such use does not violate Section 3 (Restrictions) or any separate written agreement
with the Licensor.

No other rights are granted, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.


## 3. Restrictions (What You Are Not Allowed To Do)

Unless you have an explicit, written permission or a separate written agreement from the Licensor,
you are **strictly prohibited** from:

3.1. **Redistribution & Upload**
- Republishing, uploading, or distributing the Software (or any substantial part of it) in any
  public or semi-public way (including, without limitation, other Git hosting platforms, modpacks,
  launchers, mirrors, file-sharing sites, or game servers made available to the public).

3.2. **Modification for Public Use**
- Modifying, adapting, decompiling, reverse engineering, or otherwise creating derivative works
  of the Software **for the purpose of distribution or public use**.

3.3. **Commercial Use**
- Using the Software, or any derivative of it, **for commercial purposes** (including paid access,
  monetised servers, paid modpacks, or any other revenue-generating activity) unless explicitly
  licensed to do so in a separate written agreement with the Licensor.

3.4. **Removal of Notices**
- Removing, altering, or obscuring any copyright notices, license headers, or branding embedded
  in the Software, its binaries, or associated materials.

3.5. **Circumvention**
- Circumventing, attempting to circumvent, disabling, or interfering with any license-checking or
  technical protection mechanisms (e.g. HellasControl, license servers, or similar).

3.6. **Misrepresentation**
- Claiming authorship of the Software, implying endorsement by the Licensor, or using the
  “Hephaestus Forge” or “Hellas” names, logos, or trademarks in a way that may cause confusion
  about origin or affiliation.


## 4. Open Source Components

Where the Software includes or depends on third-party open source components, those components are
licensed under their respective licenses. Nothing in this License is intended to limit, restrict, or
override rights granted by those third-party licenses.

If a third-party license conflicts with this License, the third-party license will govern only for
that component, and this License will continue to apply to the rest of the Software.


## 5. Unauthorized Use & Contractual Penalty

5.1. Any reproduction, redistribution, public upload, public provision (e.g. as part of a publicly
accessible server, modpack, or launcher), or modification of the Software in violation of Section 3
constitutes unauthorised use and a material breach of this License, as well as an infringement of
German copyright law (Urheberrechtsgesetz).

5.2. In accordance with §§ 339 ff. BGB (German Civil Code), the Licensee agrees to pay the Licensor
a contractual penalty (**Vertragsstrafe**) as follows, for each **proven** case of unauthorised use:

- **€10,000 (ten thousand euros)** for the first distinct, proven violation; and  
- **€50,000 (fifty thousand euros)** for each subsequent, distinct violation.

5.3. Each separate, independently verifiable act of unauthorised use (for example, each
distinct distribution channel, separate modpack, or separately operated server) may be treated as
its own violation.

5.4. The contractual penalty becomes due upon written notice from the Licensor specifying the
violation. The penalty remains payable unless and until a competent German court determines a
different, proportionate amount.

5.5. Payment of the contractual penalty does **not** exclude or limit the Licensor’s right to seek
additional remedies, including but not limited to injunctive relief, damages, and reimbursement of
legal costs and fees. The Licensor may choose to claim either the contractual penalty or actual
damages for a given violation, but is not obligated to claim both.


## 6. Termination

6.1. This License automatically terminates for the Licensee if they breach any provision of this
License.

6.2. Upon termination, the Licensee must immediately:
- stop using the Software;  
- delete all local and remote copies of the Software in their possession or control; and  
- cease any further distribution, operation, or public availability of the Software and any
  derivatives.

6.3. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including but not limited to
Sections 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9) shall continue in full force and effect.


## 7. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF
DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

THE LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR
THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.


## 8. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR
ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS,
REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE LICENSOR’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE SHALL BE LIMITED
TO THE AMOUNTS (IF ANY) PAID BY THE LICENSEE DIRECTLY TO THE LICENSOR FOR THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE
GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM.


## 9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

9.1. This License and all disputes arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed
exclusively by the laws of the **Federal Republic of Germany**, excluding its conflict-of-law rules.

9.2. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this
License shall be the competent courts at the Licensor’s current place of residence in Germany, or,
if the Licensor is no longer residing in Germany, at the courts of the Licensor’s last registered
residence within Germany.

9.3. If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable by a competent court, the
remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid provision shall be
replaced by a valid one that most closely reflects the original economic intent.


## 10. Changes to This License

The Licensor may publish updated versions of this unified license from time to time. Unless
explicitly stated otherwise, newer versions will not retroactively affect rights already granted
under prior versions, but may apply to future releases of the Software.

The version of this License that applies to a given copy of the Software is the version bundled
with that copy (for example, the `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file included in the repository or
release).
